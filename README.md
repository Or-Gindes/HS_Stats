### Intro 

This project is a part of the ITC Data Science and Machine Learning Cohort. 
The project revolves around Data Mining, a task that Data Scientists often have to do. 
The Data Mining technique which will be used in this project is web scraping. 
Web scraping is a Data Mining technique used to extract data from websites. 


### What is the project about ? 

This project revolves around Hearthstone. 
Hearthstone is a digital turn-based card game developed and released by Blizzard Entertainment. 
Each player has a deck of 30 cards, with reducing the opponent's health points to 0 being the target. 

Each card has many attributes:
* Classes (9 in total - Warrior, Mage, Priest etc..)
* Types (Minion, Spell, Weapon etc..)
* Rarity (Common, Rare etc..)
* Cost


### What questions do we ask  ? 



### Where do we go to then ?

* We used the website 'http://hsreplay.net', which serves as a statistical monitor of the game and holds many kinds of data.
    * We parsed the live feed (updated about every second) to get the players' decks.
    * We parsed the decks to get the card names that it consists of.
    * For each card in the players' decks, we extracted its useful info.


### Challenges 

* Reproducibility in different operating systems.

### Insights and conclusions 

* TBC
